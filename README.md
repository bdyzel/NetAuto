* ## Description
This git repo is a mix of some testing scripts used to get familiarize with Ansible, YAML, Jinja2, etc, these items will all be placed under a Test Script Folder, with the more "Production" type scripts and playbooks located under the LAB Scripts folder.

* ## Ansible
Run from an Ubuntu Vagrant install done on Virtual box by following Ivan Pepelnjak's step by step guide.

* ## The lab environment
A loopback connection which resides directly on Windows routes traffic from the Vagrant box to the rest of the GNS3 virtual environment which contains Cisco 7200 Series IOS Routers. The idea is to swop out one of the routers at a later stage with a XRV CSR1000, see related URL to run the XRV on Virtual Box with GNS3 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkRZRAU7n7E&t=0s).
With the swap out I would like to automate the process in order to automatically deploy as much of the configuration from the IOS router to the XRV router.
